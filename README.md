# TeXorcist :memo:

TeXorcist is a LaTeX style guide manual whose name pays homage to the game [The Textorcist: The Story of Ray Bibbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Textorcist:_The_Story_of_Ray_Bibbia). This document compiles frequently encountered writing style issues identified during previous manuscript reviews, serving as a self-help resource for "exorcising" problematic LaTeX documents. Before submitting academic papers for external review, authors should systematically verify their manuscripts against all checklist items in this guide and rectify any identified issues.

## Release :bookmark:
This manual maintains only the latest release version (with automated deprecation of older versions via GitHub Actions) to ensure version control clarity.

## Contribution :busts_in_silhouette:
We welcome and encourage contributions to this manual. Incorporating previous review feedback would significantly enhance efficiency, as it would enable the development of a unified pre-check framework. Such a shared resource would facilitate rapid iteration during the review process while maintaining quality standards.
