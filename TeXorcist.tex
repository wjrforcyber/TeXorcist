\begin{abstract}
    Inspired by the game \textit{The Textorcist: The Story of Ray Bibbia}, TeXorcist is a compilation of common writing style issues identified through contributor experience. This manual serves as a comprehensive pre-submission checklist to improve document quality before peer review. The guide covers various aspects including (but not limited to) stylistic conventions and common writing fixes - addressing these meticulous details will enhance both formatting consistency and review efficiency.

\section{Rephrasing is all you need}
The peer review process inherently involves substantial effort from all participants. Given the reciprocal nature of scholarly evaluation - where researchers both receive and provide feedback - addressing common technical and stylistic issues prior to submission represents both a practical necessity and professional courtesy. Systematically compiling and incorporating past review feedback serves two critical functions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item it reduces the burden on reviewers by eliminating easily preventable issues
    \item it establishes a knowledge base for improving future manuscript preparation.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Related paragraph}
All that needs to be pre-checked are listed as bullet points for easier reference.
\subsection{General}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Always end a sentence with a period. Be careful with misusing of comma everywhere.
    \item Check the use of quotes, use
    \begin{verbatim}
        `` and ''
    \end{verbatim}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    before and after the quotes.
    \item Check the use of ``a''/``an'' before a word.
    \item Use LLM such as GPT/Deepseek to help with rephrasing. Give detailed and concrete prompts.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Introduction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Gradually introduce instead of directly give what the paper is doing.
    \item Using one small example to illustrate the idea if possible.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Background}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Give/Mention definition of each basic term you used during the paper, do not miss any one of them.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Table \& Figure}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Give exact minimized example is better than give an abstract and vague graph.
    \item Color better results such as using method
    \begin{verbatim}
        \cellcolor{green!25}\textbf{236}
    \end{verbatim}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    is more expressive than labeling arrows in the table.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{References}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Add \textasciitilde{ } before each one of the citation/reference which created a space before targets. Such as
    \begin{verbatim}
        ~\ref{tab:SaturateResults}
    \end{verbatim}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    to reference a table or
    \begin{verbatim}
        ~\cite{FFLC}
    \end{verbatim}
    \vspace{-\baselineskip}
    to reference a paper.
    
\end{itemize}
\end{document}
